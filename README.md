Educational Toys for processing LIDAR point clouds

Here is a Technical Report following the workflow exemplified in TOIDAR for [Automated 3D reconstruction of buildings out of point clouds obtained from panoramic images](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354271068_Automated_3D_reconstruction_of_buildings_out_of_point_clouds_obtained_from_panoramic_images_Technical_Report)

TOIDAR was initially developed by Pirouz Nourian in February 2014, PhD researcher and instrcutor of Design Informatics at TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment (Technisch Ontwerp en Informatica), as a didactic tool for the course Geo1004, 3D Modelling of the Built Environment, directed by Dr. Sisi Zlatanova. The name TOIDAR stands for Technisch Ontwerp en Informatica and LIDAR point clouds. The toolkit provides methods for processing LIDAR and possibly other types of point clouds for 3D modelling. Feel free and welcome to use and contribute; but I do not have the time or obligation to respond to questions or help with using the tools. Use at your own risk.
